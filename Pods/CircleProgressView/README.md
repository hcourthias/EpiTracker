iOS CircleProgressView 
======

This control will allow a user to use code instantiated or interface builder to create and render a circle progress view.
 
This repository is referenced in the blog post: <a href="http://www.cardinalsolutions.com/cardinal/blog/mobile/2014/10/ios_circleprogressvi.html">iOS CircleProgressView</a>

NOTE: There is an Objective-C version of the control in this project as well. Cocopods however will only pull the swift project. If you need to integrate the Obj-C version, that is not supported at this time. May add a new podspec for that if someone wants to create a pull request for that feature.

* Increase or decreasing progress changes.
* Variable track width.
* Track image optional.

Requirements
-------

Xcode 8
Swift 3.0
iOS 8 +

Configuration
-------

* If you are using a swift only project simply copy CircleProgressView.swift to your project. Swift requires no specific imports.

* If you are using a hybrid app where you are starting with an objective c project, you will need to import the swift class by full name. 

```Objective-C
#import "CircleProgressView-Swift.h"
```

CocoaPods
-------
Current version is 1.0.12

```
pod 'CircleProgressView', :git => 'https://github.com/CardinalNow/iOS-CircleProgressView.git'

```

or 

```
pod 'CircleProgressView', '~> 1.0'
```

Usage
-------

CircleProgressView can be used via code or interface builder. 

* If configuring via code, use the traditional init methods and properties.

* If using Interface Builder, CircleProgressView takes advantage of Xcode 6's new 
```swift 
@IBDesignable 
``` 
and 
```swift 
@IBInspectable 
``` 
properties that allow developers to render and configure custom controls in Interface Builder.

Animation
-------

You can now update the progress view with animation using the new animated option.
